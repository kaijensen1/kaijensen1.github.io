---

I am a detail oriented critical thinker with 8 years of teaching experience. I have demonstrated skills in communicating complex and technical topics to a wide range of audiences. I earned a masterâ€™s degree in mathematics and completed the Google Data Analytics Certificate. I have experience using Python, R, SQL, and Tableau. Currently, I am looking for an opportunity to apply my experience and problem solving skills to challenging real world problems in a team setting.
