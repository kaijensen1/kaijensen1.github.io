I am a detail oriented critical thinker with 8 years of teaching experience. I have demonstrated skills in communicating complex and technical topics to a wide range of audiences. I have earned a masterâ€™s degree in mathematics and have completed the Google Data Analytics Certificate. I have experience using Python, R, SQL, and Tableau. Currently, I am looking for an opportunity to utilize my experience and problem solving skills while continuing to expand my knowledge.
