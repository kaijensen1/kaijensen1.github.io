## Business Task

Using a years worth of Bike Trip data I will explore how Cyclistic subscription members (Annual Members), and Non-members (Casual Riders) use the bike rental system differently. Using these findings I will make recommendations on designing marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members.

## Key Stakeholders

- Cyclistic executive team
- Director of Marketing for Cyclistic
- Cyclistic marketing analysis team
