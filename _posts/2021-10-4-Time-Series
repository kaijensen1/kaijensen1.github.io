## Task

Using the following data set: [Anomoly Detection Falling People](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jorekai/anomaly-detection-falling-people-events).
I attempt to create a classifier that outperforms the random forest classifier, expert knowledge agent and meta-prediction agent used in the original paper.
